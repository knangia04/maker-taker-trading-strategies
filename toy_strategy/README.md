# Toy Strategy - SMA

## About:

The goal of this strategy is to see if Strategy Studio is setup properly and if we can test our strategies as needed. 

**Note:** The Strategy here is the same as the example SMA strategy provided along with Strategy Studio, additional scripts developed execute it conveniently.

## Running:

*.h and .cpp files are the exact same as those in the examples dir of strategy studio, execute the bash script as shown below to test if everything works as expected*

Modifications:
1) Makefile: in order to ensure correct path
2) Header Names in .h file

```
chmod +x run_strategy.sh
./run_strategy.sh
```

Once that is done, run the visualization tool to view the strategy, again since conda environment is already setup, just run the individual cells in **jupyer notebook**.
