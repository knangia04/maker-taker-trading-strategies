## Getting started and System Setup

#### Cloning the Repo:

```
git clone https://gitlab.engr.illinois.edu/fin556_algo_market_micro_fall_2024/fin556_algo_market_micro_fall_2024_02/group_02_project.git
```

#### Anaconda Setup:

If you do not have Anaconda on your device, please install it using the following commands:

```
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash ~/Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

This may take some time...alternatively you could use Miniconda3

**Environment SetUp:**

conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Siddarth Aananth

**About Me:**

Hello, I am Siddarth Aananth, a senior year undergraduate at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, majoring in Computer Science and Statistics with a minor in Mathematics. I am currently exploring both the applied and theoretical dimensions of machine learning under the guidance of Prof. Vikram Adve and Prof. Arindam Banerjee. My current research focuses are: ML@Edge and Generalization Research

A sampling of my research work:
SSL Open World Object Detection (Accepted NeurIPS OWA): https://openreview.net/forum?id=1rs9HXmJUv
Analysis of Sharpness Aware Minimization (Generalization Research Initial Ideas): https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01714

Balancing my academic research with practical experience, I've also worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Rivian. Here, I've contributed to refining ADAS software models and deepening my understanding of ML infrastructure, gaining valuable insights into product development in the electric vehicle industry and the role of AI in transforming it.
